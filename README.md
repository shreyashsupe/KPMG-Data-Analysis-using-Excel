# KPMG Data Analysis using Excel

## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing customer demographics, transactions, and new customer data to provide insights into KPMG's business performance and customer behavior. The analysis is conducted using Excel across six distinct tasks, with each task organized into separate workbooks. The final task (Task 6) is presented as a PDF report summarizing the key insights and recommendations.

## Dataset
The project uses the following datasets:
1. **Customer Address Data**: Contains information about customer addresses and property valuations.
2. **Customer Demographic Data**: Includes demographic details such as customer names, gender, job titles, and wealth segments.
3. **Transaction Data**: Details customer transactions, including product IDs, dates, prices, and brands.
4. **New Customer Data**: Provides insights on potential new customers, including their demographics, property valuation, and value.

## Tasks Completed
### 1. Data Cleaning
Performed cleaning across the four datasets, ensuring data consistency and removing duplicates or erroneous data. The following corrections were made:
- Corrected state name formats and removed duplicates in the Customer Address Data.
- Standardized gender and removed anomalies in Customer Demographic Data.
- Ensured consistent date formats and removed incomplete records in Transaction Data.
- Standardized address and job titles in New Customer Data.

### 2. Customer Segmentation
Segmented customers based on:
- **Wealth Segment**: Counted customers and calculated average tenure.
- **Gender**: Analyzed customer counts and average bike-related purchases.
- **Job Industry**: Counted customers in each industry and analyzed wealth distribution within industries.

### 3. Transaction Analysis
Analyzed transaction trends and customer behavior:
- Created a sales trend chart showing monthly sales and identifying seasonal spikes.
- Analyzed product performance based on total sales for each brand and product line.
- Identified top 10 customers based on transaction value and calculated average purchases per customer.

### 4. New Customer Insights
Provided insights on potential new customers:
- Analyzed the distribution of new customers by wealth segment and job industry.
- Created a map/chart to show new customer distribution by state and correlated property valuation with wealth segment.
- Estimated potential revenue based on past purchases and customer value.

### 5. Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Analysis
Calculated the CLV for each customer using the formula:
- **CLV = (Average Purchase Value × Purchase Frequency) × Customer Lifespan**
Segmented CLV by wealth segment and analyzed relationships between CLV and customer demographics.

### 6. Executive Summary and Recommendations (PDF)
The PDF report includes:
- **Key Insights**: Summarizing customer segmentation, transaction analysis, and new customer insights.
- **Recommendations**: Suggestions for marketing strategies, business expansion, and product improvements based on the analysis.
